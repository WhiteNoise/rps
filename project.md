# Rock Paper Scissors multiplayer game

This project will be a web hosted, multiplayer rock paper scissors game. As many people can join as they want and conduct rock paper scissors battles until a single winner remains.

The winner can go on to challenge other people and the losers cannot do anything anymore.
